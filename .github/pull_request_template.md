If you want to create a pre release of this version once merged:
1. Remember to have bumped the version on VERSION.txt to something like x.y.z-rc1 or whatever release candidate it is
2. Once merged push a tag with the same name as the one on VERSION.txt
3. Finally when the github action finishes creating the draft release publish that one and check it as a pre-release
